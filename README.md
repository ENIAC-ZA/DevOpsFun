Steps:

-Install docker from - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

-After installation enable WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V/nothing.

-Install kubernetes from within docker settings menu.

-After kubernetes is installed I had access to the 'kubectl' commands and verified that everything was working,  some of the commands I used were:

'kubectl get nodes'

'kubectl get ns'
